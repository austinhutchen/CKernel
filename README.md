#    CS 2400 - Shell Lab: Writing Your Own Unix Shell

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with the
concepts of process control and signalling. You'll do this by writing a
simple Unix shell program that supports job control.

## Logistics

You accept the assignment through Github Classroom.
The only "hand-in" will be electronic. Any clarifications and revisions to the assignment will be posted on the course Moodle page.

- You can work on this lab using any Linux-like environment (Linux, WSL2, MacOS) but grading and checking will be done on the reference Ubuntu-22.04 environment supported by [https://coding.csel.io](https://coding.csel.io)
-   Type the command *make* to compile and link some test routines.

Looking at the tsh.cc (tsh stands for *tiny shell*) file, you will see that it contains
a functional skeleton of a simple Unix shell. To help you get started,
we have already implemented the less interesting functions; some of
these are in the file `helper_routines.cc`, and these have been
separated in another file to make it easier to focus on the work you
need to do in tsh.cc. You should only have to change tsh.cc

Your assignment is to complete the remaining empty functions listed
below in tsh.cc. As a sanity check for you, we've listed the approximate
number of lines of code for each of these functions in our reference
solution (which includes lots of comments).

* eval: Main routine that parses and interprets the command line. \[70  lines\]

* builtin\_cmd: Recognizes and interprets the built-in commands: quit,
    fg, bg, and jobs. \[25 lines\]

* do\_bgfg: Implements the bg and fg built-in commands. \[50 lines\]

* waitfg: Waits for a foreground job to complete. \[20 lines\]

* sigchld\_handler: Catches SIGCHILD signals. 80 lines\]

* sigint\_handler: Catches SIGINT (ctrl-c) signals. \[15 lines\]

* sigtstp\_handler: Catches SIGTSTP (ctrl-z) signals. \[15 lines\]

Each time you modify your tsh.cc file, type make to recompile it. To run
your shell, type ./tsh to the command line:

```
unix> ./tsh 
tsh>         *type commands to your shell here*
```

## General Overview of Unix Shells

A *shell* is an interactive command-line interpreter that runs programs
on behalf of the user. A shell repeatedly prints a prompt, waits for a
*command line* on stdin, and then carries out some action, as directed
by the contents of the command line.

The command line is a sequence of ASCII text words delimited by
whitespace. The first word in the command line is either the name of a
built-in command or the pathname of an executable file. The remaining
words are command-line arguments. If the first word is a built-in
command, the shell immediately executes the command in the current
process. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be the pathname of an
executable program. In this case, the shell forks a child process, then
loads and runs the program in the context of the child. The child
processes created as a result of interpreting a single command line are
known collectively as a *job*. In general, a job can consist of multiple
child processes connected by Unix pipes.

If the command line ends with an ampersand "&", then the job runs in the
*background*, which means that the shell does not wait for the job to
terminate before printing the prompt and awaiting the next command line.
Otherwise, the job runs in the *foreground*, which means that the shell
waits for the job to terminate before awaiting the next command line.
Thus, at any point in time, at most one job can be running in the
foreground. However, an arbitrary number of jobs can run in the
background.

For example, typing the command line
```
tsh> jobs
```
causes the shell to execute the built-in jobs command.

### Command Line Arugments
Typing the
command line
```
tsh>/bin/ls -l -d
```
runs the `/bin/ls` program in the foreground. By convention, the shell ensures
that when the program begins executing a programs `main` routine declared as such:
```
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
```
is called so that the `argc` and `argv` arguments have the following values for this example:

-   argc == 3,

-   argv\[0\] == "/bin/ls",

-   argv\[1\]== "-l",

-   argv\[2\]== "-d".

Alternatively, typing the command line
```
tsh>/bin/ls -l -d &
```
runs the ls program in the background. Note that the ampersand (&) is not passed to the program in the arugments.

### Job control
Unix shells support the notion of *job control*, which allows users to
move jobs back and forth between background and foreground, and to
change the process state (running, stopped, or terminated) of the
processes in a job. Typing ctrl-c causes a SIGINT signal to be delivered
to each process in the foreground job. The default action for SIGINT is
to terminate the process. Similarly, typing ctrl-z causes a SIGTSTP
signal to be delivered to each process in the foreground job. The
default action for SIGTSTP is to place a process in the stopped state,
where it remains until it is awakened by the receipt of a SIGCONT
signal. Unix shells also provide various built-in commands that support
job control. For example:

-   jobs: List the running and stopped background jobs.

-   bg \<job\>: Change a stopped background job to a running background
    job.

-   fg \<job\>: Change a stopped or running background job to a running
    in the foreground.

-   kill \<job\>: Terminate a job.

## The tsh Specification

Your tsh shell should have the following features:

-   The prompt should be the string "tsh\> ".

-   The command line typed by the user should consist of a name and zero
    or more arguments, all separated by one or more spaces. If name is a
    built-in command, then tsh should handle it immediately and wait for
    the next command line. Otherwise, tsh should assume that name is the
    path of an executable file, which it loads and runs in the context
    of an initial child process (In this context, the term *job* refers
    to this initial child process).

-   tsh need not support pipes (\|) or I/O redirection (\< and \>).

-   Typing ctrl-c (ctrl-z) should cause a SIGINT (SIGTSTP) signal to be
    sent to the current foreground job, as well as any descendents of
    that job (e.g., any child processes that it forked). If there is no
    foreground job, then the signal should have no effect.

-   If the command line ends with an ampersand &, then tsh should run
    the job in the background. Otherwise, it should run the job in the
    foreground.

-   Each job can be identified by either a process ID (PID) or a job ID
    (JID), which is a positive integer assigned by tsh. Job ID's are
    used because some scripts need to manipulate certain jobs, and the
    process ID's change across runs. JIDs should be denoted on the
    command line by the prefix '`%`'. For example, "%5" denotes JID 5,
    and "5" denotes PID 5. (We have provided you with all of the
    routines you need for manipulating the job list.)

-   tsh should support the following built-in commands:

    -   The quit command terminates the shell.

    -   The jobs command lists all background jobs.

    -   The bg \<job\> command restarts \<job\> by sending it a SIGCONT
        signal, and then runs it in the background. The \<job\> argument
        can be either a PID or a JID.

    -   The fg \<job\> command restarts \<job\> by sending it a SIGCONT
        signal, and then runs it in the foreground. The \<job\> argument
        can be either a PID or a JID.

-   tsh should reap all of its zombie children. If any job terminates
    because it receives a signal that it didn't catch, then tsh should
    recognize this event and print a message with the job's PID and a
    description of the offending signal.

## Checking Your Work

We have provided some tools to help you check your work.

**Reference solution.** The Linux executable `tshref` is the reference
solution for the shell. Run this program to resolve any questions you
have about how your shell should behave. *Your shell should emit output
that is identical to the reference solution* (except for process
identifiers (PIDs) that change from run to run).

**Shell driver.** The sdriver.pl program executes a shell as a child
process, sends it commands and signals as directed by a *trace file*,
and captures and displays the output from the shell.

Use the -h argument to find out the usage of sdriver.pl:
```
unix> ./sdriver.pl 
Missing required -t argument
Usage: ./sdriver.pl [-hv] -t <trace> -s <shellprog> -a <args>
Options:
  -h            Print this message
  -v            Be more verbose
  -t <trace>    Trace file
  -s <shell>    Shell program to test
  -a <args>     Shell arguments
  -g            Generate output for autograder
```
We have also provided 16 trace files ( trace{01-16}.txt) that you will
use in conjunction with the shell driver to test the correctness of your
shell. The lower-numbered trace files do very simple tests, and the
higher-numbered tests do more complicated tests.

You can run the shell driver on your shell using trace file trace01.txt
(for instance) by typing:
```
unix>./sdriver.pl -t trace01.txt -s ./tsh -a "-p"
```
(the -a "-p" argument tells your shell not to emit a prompt), or
```
unix> make test01
```
Similarly, to compare your result with the reference shell, you can run
the trace driver on the reference shell by typing:
```
unix>./sdriver.pl -t trace01.txt -s ./tshref -a "-p"
```
or
```
unix> make rtest01
```

For your reference, tshref.out gives the output of the reference
solution on all races. This might be more convenient for you than
manually running the shell driver on all trace files.


## Hints

-   Read **every word** of the chapter on Exceptional Control Flow in
    your textbook.

-   Use the trace files to guide the development of your shell. Starting
    with trace01.txt, make sure that your shell produces the *identical*
    output as the reference shell. Then move on to trace file
    trace02.txt, and so on.

-   The `waitpid`, `kill`, `fork`, `execve`, `setpgid`, and `sigprocmask` functions
    will come in very handy. The `WUNTRACED` and `WNOHANG` options to
    waitpid will also be useful. These are described in detail in the
    text.

-   When you implement your signal handlers, be sure to send `SIGINT` and
    `SIGTSTP` signals to the **entire** foreground process group, using
    `-pid` instead of `pid` in the argument to the `kill` function. The
    `sdriver.pl` program tests for this error.

-   One of the tricky parts of the assignment is deciding on the
    allocation of work between the waitfg and `sigchld_handler`
    functions. We recommend the following approach:

    -   In `waitfg`, use a busy loop around the sleep function.

    -   In `sigchld_handler`, use exactly one call to `waitpid`.

    While other solutions are possible, such as calling waitpid in both
    waitfg and sigchld\_handler, these can be very confusing. It is
    simpler to do all reaping in the handler.

-   In `eval`, the parent must use `sigprocmask` to block `SIGCHLD` signals
    before it forks the child, and then unblock these signals, again
    using `sigprocmask` after it adds the child to the job list by calling
    `addjob`. Since children inherit the blocked vectors of their parents,
    the child must be sure to then unblock `SIGCHLD` signals before it
    execs the new program.

    The parent needs to block the `SIGCHLD` signals in this way in order
    to avoid the race condition where the child is reaped by
    `sigchld_handler` (and thus removed from the job list) *before* the
    parent calls `addjob`.

-   Programs such as `more`, `less`, `vi`, and `emacs` do strange things with
    the terminal settings. Don't run these programs from your tsh.
    Stick with simple text-based programs such as `/bin/ls`, `/bin/ps`, and
    `/bin/echo`.

-   When you run your shell from the standard Unix shell, your shell is
    running in the foreground process group. If your shell then creates
    a child process, by default that child will also be a member of the
    foreground process group. Since typing ctrl-c sends a `SIGINT` to
    every process in the foreground group, typing ctrl-c will send a
    SIGINT to your shell, as well as to every process that your shell
    created, which obviously isn't correct.

    Here is the workaround: After the `fork`, but before the `execve`, the
    child process should call `setpgid(0, 0)`, which puts the child in a
    new process group whose group ID is identical to the child's PID.
    This ensures that there will be only one process, your shell, in the
    foreground process group. When you type ctrl-c, the shell should
    catch the resulting `SIGINT` and then forward it to the appropriate
    foreground job (or more precisely, the process group that contains
    the foreground job).

## Evaluation

The `./shellAutograder.py` program will grade your shell program; you can either run this directly yourself and it will also be used when you commit your changes.

During your grading session, your solution shell will be tested for
correctness on a Linux machine (either your virtual machine or native
linux install) using the same shell driver and trace files that were
included in your lab directory. Your shell should produce **identical**
output on these traces as the reference shell, with only two exceptions:

-   The PIDs can (and will) be different.

-   The output of the /bin/ps commands in trace11.txt, trace12.txt, and
    trace13.txt will be different from run to run. However, the running
    states of any mysplit processes in the output of the /bin/ps command
    should be identical.

The "correctness" part of your assignment will be computed based on how
many of the traces you correctly execute using following distribution:

-   10% - traces 1-3

-   30% - traces 4-5

-   60% - traces 6-8

-   80% - traces 9-10

-   90% - traces 11-13

-   100% - trace 14-16

As with all assignments in CSCI 2400, you will need to be able to
explain the function of your code in your grading meeting. Correctness
is only part of your final grade.

## Using GDB to debug your shell lab with VScode

If you plan on using VScode to debug your shell lab, we need to do a little configuration. Normally, GDB "catches" the same signals your shell is supposed to catch. This stops execution and returns control to GDB when those signals occur. This means you can't just set a breakpoint in your signal handlers and expect to have the debugger notice that. 

To get around this, we will use a [`.gdbinit`](.gdbinit) file which is contained in this Git repo. By default, `gdb` will not read a local `.gdbinit` file because of security concerns. We can override that by adding an option to the `.gdbinit` file in your home directory to enable loading any gdbinit file.

To do this, cut and paste the following line into a Terminal window

```
echo "set auto-load safe-path /" >> ~/.gdbinit
```

Following this, the local `.gdbinit` shoudld be loaded. If you want to change the local `.gdbinit` you can learn more about the signal configurations [at this GDB manual](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Signals.html).

Good luck!
